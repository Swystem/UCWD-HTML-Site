			<h2 id="iaido"> Iaido </h2>

					<br />
			<p> Iaido is a martial art which focuses primarily on drawing the sword and striking with it quickly in a single movement as a response to sudden attack, but it is also steeped
			in philosophy, and focuses on self-improvement over combative applications of the movements performed. It is occasionally referred to as a
			form of moving meditation rather than a combat discipline. Most of the kata in iaido are performed alone, with the practicioner - or iaidoka -
			striking against imagined enemies and focusing on their form as they do. <br />
			<br />
			The name iaido (居合道), often abbreviated to iai (居合), takes its name from a combination of the saying <i>Tsune ni ite, kyū ni awasu</i> (常に居て、急に合わす), which can be loosely translated to
			"being constantly (prepared), match/meet (the opposition) immediately". Therefore, a great deal of emphasis is placed on mindfulness (居), followed by speed (合). The third character, (道), loosely
			translates to 'the way of', denoting it as an art and discipline. <br />
			<br />
			Kata begin with the sword in its sheath or <i>saya</i> and the iaidoka in an at-ease position, often sitting in the <i>seiza</i> position,  which appears to the western eye as kneeling. From there, the iaidoka
			draws their weapon and performs a series of attacks and movements, before coming to a stop and performing a <i>chiburi</i>, literally <i>blood shake</i>, to symbolise quickly cleaning their weapon
			before sheathing it.
			<br />
			Iaido requires fairly minimal equipment - the clothing worn is traditional Japanese clothing which can be purchased from our shop:
			<ul>
				<li>Hakama - A parted skirt which resembles a pleated pair of wide trousers, commonly worn by samurai in the past and in formal settings in Japan today.</li>
				<li>Obi - A belt or sash used partially to decorate the outfit, but in a practical sense used to hold a sword to your person.</li>
				<li>Iaigi - Perhaps the most recognisable part of the clothing, the iaigi is the upper part of the uniform - an open jacket held closed by ties on the inside.</li>
				<li>Shitagi - The shitagi is like an iaigi, but made of thinner, lighter material and designed to be worn beneath the iaigi.</li>
			</ul>
			In addition, iaidoka may wish to wear traditional japanese sandals - geta, zori, or waraji - and tabi, a kind of soled sock. These will both have to be removed when practicing.<br />
			<br />
			As well as the uniform, each iaidoka must have their own weapon. We can provide loaned weapons for newcomers, but eventually each practicioner will need their own.<br />
			<br />
			Novice iaidoka use wooden swords called either bokken or bokuto, which are designed to mimic the balance and form of the real thing. In this 
			way, it is possible to assure that injuries are kept to a minimum while practicing, particularly in paired kata. <br />
			<br />
			Intermediate students - typically first dan and onwards - are granted the privilege of using a full metal sword, an iaito. Iaito are typically made of a zinc-aluminium alloy
			and are designed to mimic the weight, balance, and feel of a proper sword while being unable to hold any kind of edge. They are more dangerous than bokuto, however, as their
			points are still quite sharp and they are still made of metal. <br />
			<br />
			Advanced iaidoka - usually fourth dan and onwards - are given the honour of using a 'shinken', or 'live blade', which is a full-fledged katana with a sharp edge. At the very highest level,
			iaidoka can be seen practicing with shinken in pairs. In such a setting, a mistake can be fatal.<br />
			<br />
			The club's iaido classes run for two hours every Sunday in our dojo from 10AM - 12PM. </p>

			<h2 id="kendo"> Kendo </h2>
			<img src = "resources/kendo.jpeg"

					<br />
			<p> Kendo is a martial art which focuses exclusively on combat with a sword. It is based on the dozens of old Japanese kenjutsu schools that have existed since around 1300. Around 1700, Naganuma Shirōzaemon Kunisato first
			tried the use of the now-iconic <i>shinai</i> bamboo practice swords and <i>bōgu</i> armour in order to reduce deaths and serious injuries which could occur during sword practice, even with wooden bokken.
			It is often reffered to as a blend of the strict discipline of martial arts and the strenuous activity of sport. Practicioners are referred to as 'kendoka'.<br />
			<br />
			The name kendo (剣道) literally translates to "Sword Way", but more properly translated means "The way of the Sword". The kata practiced in kendo take the form of strict pair-based combat scenarios 
			which have been used to train kendoka for around three centuries. Kendo assumes both combatants are ready to fight, with their weapons drawn and in full armour. This is in contrast to iaido, 
			which places great emphasis on being ready even when one is not ready.<br />
			<br />
			Kendo has some of the most extensive equipment requirements in all of the martial arts world, requiring full armour and a weapon as well as gi, hakama, and obi. All of this can be purchased from our shop:
			<ul>
				<li>Hakama - A parted skirt which resembles a pleated pair of wide trousers, commonly worn by samurai in the past and in formal settings in Japan today.</li>
				<li>Obi - A belt or sash used partially to decorate the outfit, but in a practical sense used to hold a sword to your person.</li>
				<li>Kendogi - Perhaps the most recognisable part of the clothing, the iaigi is the upper part of the uniform - an open jacket held closed by ties on the inside.</li>
				<li>Shitagi - The shitagi is like an iaigi, but made of thinner, lighter material and designed to be worn beneath the iaigi.</li>
				<li>Men - The men is a stylised helmet whose name translates literally to 'face', which has a metal grille covering the face and flaps to protect the throat.</li>
				<li>Dō - The dō is a chest-plate. This has been used to historically refer to chestplates of samurai combat armour as well as the kendo dō.</li>
				<li>Tare - The tare is a thick belt which wraps around the waist and has flaps to protect the groin.</li>
				<li>Kote - The kote are a pair of mitten-like gloves designed specifically for kendo. Historically, kote - archaically called gote - referred to gauntlets worn by samurai as well, though these were often more like vambraces.</li>
			</ul>
			As mentioned above, as well as this armour, each kendoka requires their own weapon - a bamboo shinai. The shinai is a practice sword made of several bunched slates of bamboo - the result is a weapon which 
			resembles a sword, but does not weigh anywhere near as much as a solid wood bokken and is far more shock absorbent and bouncy, essentially meaning that it will not cause any damage to an armoured opponent.
			Due to kendo's extensive equipment requirements, the club can provide some spare sets for novices, but encourages its students to purchase their own equipment as soon as possible.<br />
			<br /> 
			The club's kendo classes run for two hours every Wednesday from 7PM - 9PM. </p>

			<h2 id="jodo"> Jōdō </h2>
			<img src = "resources/jodo.png"
					alt="Two silhouetted jōdōka sparring."

					<br />
			<p> Jōdō is a martial art which focuses primarily on the use of a staff just over a metre in length called a jō to defend against armed assailants. It is related to bōjutsu, which is often seen in popular media. 
			Legend tells that four centuries ago, the master swordsman Musō Gonnosuke Katsuyoshi developed jōdo as a
			means of defending against a sword-wielding opponent following his defeat in single combat at the hands of Miyamoto Musashi. According to the stories, the duel was agreed and Gonnosuke chose to fight with a bō, 
			a weapon he was said to wield with unrivaled skill. Accounts differ on Musashi's choice of weapon, but it would have been either twin swords or twin bokken, as was his custom. The story goes that during the duel,
			Musashi caught Gonnosuke's bō in a cross-block, and since Gonnosuke could not stop any counter-attack Musashi may have launched, he was defeated. Musashi, as he often did, elected to spare his defeated opponent.
			As a result of lessons learnt from this duel, Gonnosuke developed the jō - a bō that was much shorter and therefore more versatile allowing for reversal of the weapon in close quarters. Practicioners are referred 
			to as 'jōdōka'.<br />
			<br />
			The name jōdō (杖道), is simply a combination of the name of the jō (杖) and the word dō(道), similar to kendō. Most of the kata in jōdō are paired exercises with one combatant using a jō and the other using a bokken.<br />
			<br />
			Jōdō requires fairly minimal equipment - the clothing worn is traditional Japanese clothing which can be purchased from our shop:
			<ul>
				<li>Hakama - A parted skirt which resembles a pleated pair of wide trousers, commonly worn by samurai in the past and in formal settings in Japan today.</li>
				<li>Obi - A belt or sash used partially to decorate the outfit, but in a practical sense used to hold a sword to your person.</li>
				<li>Iaigi - Perhaps the most recognisable part of the clothing, the iaigi is the upper part of the uniform - an open jacket held closed by ties on the inside.</li>
				<li>Shitagi - The shitagi is like an iaigi, but made of thinner, lighter material and designed to be worn beneath the iaigi.</li>
			</ul>
			In addition, jōdōka may wish to wear traditional japanese sandals - geta, zori, or waraji - and tabi, a kind of soled sock. These will both have to be removed when practicing.<br />
			<br />
			As well as the uniform, each jōdōka must have their own weapon. We can provide loaned weapons for newcomers, but eventually each practicioner will need their own. Jō are available in our shop, and are
			pine staves about 1.2m in length. <br />
			<br />
			The club's jōdō classes run for two hours every Saturday in our dojo from 4PM - 6PM. </p>
