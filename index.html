			<h1> Who We Are </h1>
			<p> We are a martial arts school in Talbot, Bournemouth. Our primary focus is on the use of martial arts as a means of meditation, reflection, and self-improvement.
			We also teach practical applications of the arts we teach, allowing our students to protect themselves and those they care about should the need to do so arise.
			Founded in 1977 by Sensei Duncan Alger, we specialise in the arts of Jodo, Iaido, and Kenjutsu and are as such certified by the British Kendo Association. </p>
			<aside>
				<h4>Our Lineage</h4>
				<p> The school of iaido taught by the Academy is called Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu, which claims an unbroken lineage dating back to the 16th Century.</p>
